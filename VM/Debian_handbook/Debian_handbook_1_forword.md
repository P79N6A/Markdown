- Book Orgaration:

    - **Chapter 1** focuses on a non-technical presentation of the Debian project and describes its goals
and organization. These aspects are important because they define a general framework that
others chapters will complete with more concrete information. 
    
    - **Chapters 2 and 3** provide a broad outline of the case study. At this point, novice readers can take the time to read **appendix B**, where they'll find a short remedial course explaining a number of
basic computing notions, as well as concepts inherent to any Unix system.

    -  To get on with our real subject matter, we will quite naturally start with the installation process **(chapter 4); chapters 5 and 6** will unveil basic tools that any Debian administrator will use,
such as those of the **APT** family, which is largely responsible for the distribution's excellent reputation. These chapters are in no way reserved to professionals, since everyone is their own
administrator at home. 

    - **Chapter 7** will be an important parenthesis; it describes workflows to efficiently use documen-tation and to quickly gain an understanding of problems in order to solve them.

    - The next chapters will be a more detailed tour of the system, **starting with basic infrastructure and services (chapters 8 to 10)** and going progressively up the stack to reach the user appli-
cations **in chapter 13**. **Chapter 12** deals with more advanced subjects that will most directly concern administrators of large sets of computers (including servers), while **chapter 14** is a
brief introduction to the wider subject of computer security and gives a few keys to avoid most problems.

    - **Chapter 15** is for administrators who want to go further and create their own Debian packages.
    
- Crowded funding:

    The campaign had two goals: raising €15,000 for the translation and completing a €25,000 liber-
ation fund to get the resulting book published under a free license — that is, a license that fully
follows the Debian Free Software Guidelines.
