## Summary Of GDB ##

gdb can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of these) to help you
catch bugs in the act:

- Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.

- Make your program stop on specified conditions.

- Examine what has happened, when your program has stopeed.

- Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.

### GDB is GPL ###

- Fundamentally, the General Public License is a license which says that you have these
freedoms and that you cannot take these freedoms away from anyone else.

- The criteria of freedom for a free manual are roughly the same as for free software.
Redistribution (including the normal kinds of commercial redistribution) must be permitted,
so that the manual can accompany every copy of the program, both on-line and on paper
