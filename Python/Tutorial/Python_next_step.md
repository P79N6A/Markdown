### What Now ###

- [The Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/index.html#library-index)

- [Installing Python Modules (Legacy version)](https://docs.python.org/2/install/index.html#install-index) : explain how to install external modules written by other Python users.

-  [The Python Language Reference](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/index.html#reference-index) : A detailed explanation of Python's syntax and semantics. It's reading, but is useful as complete guide to the language itself.

### More  Python resources: ###

- **https://www.python.org:** The major Python Web site. It contains code, documentation, and pointers to Python-related pages around the Web. This Web site is mirrored in various places around the world, such as Europe, Japan, and Australia; a mirror may be faster than the main site, depending on your geographical location.

- **https://docs.python.org:** Fast access to Python’s documentation.
https://pypi.python.org/pypi: The Python Package Index, previously also nicknamed the Cheese Shop, is an index of user-created Python modules that are available for download. Once you begin releasing code, you can register it here so that others can find it.

- **https://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/**: The Python Cookbook is a sizable collection of code examples, larger modules, and useful scripts. Particularly notable contributions are collected in a book also titled Python Cookbook (O’Reilly & Associates, ISBN 0-596-00797-3.)

	For Python-related questions and problem reports, you can post to the **newsgroup comp.lang.python**, or send them to the mailing list at **python-list@python.org**. The newsgroup and mailing list are gatewayed, so messages posted to one will automatically be forwarded to the other. There are around 120 postings a day (with peaks up to several hundred), asking (and answering) questions, suggesting new features, and announcing new modules. Before posting, **be sure to check the list of Frequently Asked Questions (also called the FAQ)**. Mailing list archives are available at https://mail.python.org/pipermail/. The FAQ answers many of the questions that come up again and again, and may already contain the solution for your problem.
